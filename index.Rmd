## About "Me"

I am a graduate student in [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu) and focus on Statistical Genetics. Before that, I received my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences from Shandong University in China. I believe you will know more about me by looking through my recent [cv](cv.html).

I like travelling and photograghy although I do not own a camera. 

In relationship with "MR. SOMEONE" ❤️.
